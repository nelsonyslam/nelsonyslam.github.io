I am currently a postdoc in Prof. Jin-Quan Yu's lab [https://www.scripps.edu/yu] at the Scripps Research Institute developing new strategies for Câ€“H activation reactions. I completed my PhD at the University of Cambridge (2019) with Prof. Ian Paterson [http://www-paterson.ch.cam.ac.uk] working in natural product total synthesis.

I am originally from New Zealand, having completed my undergraduate degree in Music and Science at the University of Auckland. My Honours dissertation was conducted with the supervision of Prof. Christian Hartinger on the development of novel ruthenium-based anticancer therapies [https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/c-hartinger]

My research interests are in the areas of: organic synthesis, catalysis and chemical biology
